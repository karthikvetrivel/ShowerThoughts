In simplest terms, a showerthought is a miniature epiphany that makes the mundane more interesting. It’s an idea that offers people a new way of considering details that they might have otherwise overlooked. Showerthoughts can be funny, poignant, thought-provoking, or even just silly, but they should always prompt people to say “Huh, I’ve never thought about it that way before!”
